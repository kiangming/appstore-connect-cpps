# TODO — Tech Debt & Deferred Work

Format: `- [ ] [PR-X] description — file path — rationale`

## From PR-2 (Team page + guarded user mutations)

- [ ] [PR-2] Replace `zodResolver(schema) as any` cast in team forms — `app/(dashboard)/store-submissions/config/team/*` — temporary workaround for RHF v7 + Zod v4 typing mismatch; revisit when react-hook-form v8 stable ships.
- [ ] [PR-2] Replace `window.confirm()` disable-user flow with shadcn `AlertDialog` — team page disable/demote actions — native confirm is ugly + not themeable; defer to UI polish pass after MVP.
- [ ] [PR-2] `countActiveManagers()` helper currently unused — `lib/store-submissions/queries/*` — keep for future use cases (reports, audit checks). Add `@internal` JSDoc so it isn't flagged as dead code by future sweeps.
